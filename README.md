### Trivia
- Difference between `scikit-learn` and `mne.decoding.Scaler`
`scikit-learn` scales each *classification feature* (each time point across channels) with mean and standard deviation computed across epochs.
`mne.decoding.Scaler` scales each *channel* using mean and standard deviation computed across all of its time points and epochs.
